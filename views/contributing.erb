Core Projects

These projects are under the wing of the core RubyGems team.

RubyGems
Ruby’s premier packaging system. Bundled with Ruby 1.9+ and available for Ruby 1.8. Any time you run gem at the command line, you’re using this project.

Code Guidelines

New features should be coupled with tests.
Ensure that your code blends well with ours (eg, no trailing whitespace, match indentation and coding style).
Don’t modify the history file or version number.
If you have any questions, just ask us on IRC in #rubygems or file an issue.
RubyGems.org
The Ruby community’s gem hosting service. Provides a better API for accessing, deploying, and managing gems along with clear and accessible project pages.

RubyGems.org API Library
A Ruby implementation of the various API endpoints available on RubyGems.org. If you’re writing a service in Ruby to interact with gems available to the community, check this out!

RubyGems Search
A souped-up implementation of search on RubyGems.org, using Solr. Still not 100% done yet, but hopefully will replace the search box on RubyGems.org soon!

RubyGems Mirror
The current state of mirroring RubyGems is frankly embarrassing. We need RubyGems to be highly available all over the world, no more excuses! Discussion is going on in the rubygems-mirror wiki on how to improve it.

Ecosystem Projects

These projects are outside of the RubyGems core, but work closely with RubyGems to improve the gem experience for everyone.

Bundler
Bundler manages an application’s dependencies through its entire life across many machines systematically and repeatably.

Isolate
A simple gem sandbox that makes sure your application has the exact gem versions you require. It does not perform dependency resolution like Bundler.

RubyDoc.info
A fantastic provider of YARD documentation for every RubyGem available. Push a gem, and you get docs created instantly! RubyGems.org links to this site and it uses RubyGems.org’s webhooks as well.

Stickler
Stickler is a great way to run and organize an internal gem server in your organization. It helps with mirroring gems and providing a gem source to add internal or proprietary code to.

Geminabox
Need simple RubyGems hosting? Geminabox can do that! This project provides an easy to setup way to host RubyGems internally and allow uploading of gems without much hassle.
